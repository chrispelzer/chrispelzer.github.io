20+ years of experience in creating and maintaining web sites and applications of various
sizes and integrations. I specialize in using the Laravel PHP framework and a variety of tools and
workflows such as webpack, Tailwind CSS, testing, and APM. I am also the creator and maintainer of
the popular open-source Laravel [Nova CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG](https://github.com/waynestate/nova-ckeditor4-field) field. With a team of developers, I have
successfully delivered over 500+ sites and applications. I am always seeking to expand my skill set
and take on new challenges in the web development industry.
